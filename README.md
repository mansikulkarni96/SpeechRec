# SpeechRec
A java application to turn verbal words into Java code

Description:
A desktop application that takes user voice input and converts it into code on the code editor.

Inspiration:
People experience difficulties with typing for various reasons: breaking arms and disabilities.  But we believe that these obstacles shouldn't determine their ability to code. Thinking about making coding accessible and available to every user, we made this app happen!

What it does:
Our project allows the users to code without really typing anything on the keyboard, in other words, it converts their speech into the code and saves the output in java format.

How we built it:
We made it using Java APIs and Google Cloud Platform
